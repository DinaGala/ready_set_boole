 12 exercises of computer-related mathematics using Boolean Algebra and Set Theory


How to use

From the repository root, build everything:

make
# executables will be in build/bin/, e.g. build/bin/ex01_multiplier
./build/bin/ex01

Build just one exercise (library still built as needed):
make ex=ex01
./build/bin/ex01

Clean:
make clean

The library is built once to build/lib/librsb.a.
